# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass Project was a website design project for DriverPass which is a driver's Education company that wanted to expand their customer reach by implementing an online website where they can offer their customers packages of training to pass the DMV driving and written tests with full support for study material and up-to-date training that meets DMV regulations as they come out. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I think the diagram for Project 2 was done particularly well to provide a visual understanding of how each user interacts with the system differently.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think if I slowed down my pace in general, I could have improved the overall quality of my Work and caught more of my weak areas that could have improved with more detail and attention to them.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I was able to interpret the User's needs from the interview transcript. This gave us a critical insight of what the user was requesting for the project as well as why they felt it was an important need.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The way to approach designing software is to gather as many of the non-functional and functional requirements as possible, then implement that into a use case diagram so that there is a visual representation of how the requirements work as an environment for the user.
This allows us to review the system in general and see where we may need to improve or integrate more system to better meet the requirements given to us.
